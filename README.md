# Luxury Watch Product Page

## Theoretical Framework
This product page implements modern e-commerce representation theory, focusing on visual hierarchy, information architecture, and user engagement patterns. The design leverages cognitive psychology principles to optimize the consumer decision journey through strategic content placement and interactive elements.

- Hierarchical visual navigation (primary + secondary imagery)
- Color theory application in UI elements

### Information Architecture

- Progressive disclosure pattern for technical specifications
- Multi-modal product representation (visual, textual, comparative)

### User Interaction Patterns
- Direct manipulation interface for product customization
- Persistent state management via local storage
- Modal dialogs as temporary information spaces

### Related Context Implementation
- Associative product linking for cross-selling
- Complementary product suggestion algorithm
- Visual similarity grouping
